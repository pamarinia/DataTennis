## Tennis Match Analysis Using Computer Vision

# Description

This personal project involves developing a system to analyze tennis matches using computer vision methods. The system extracts data from tennis match videos to identify and analyze key events.

# Features

Ball Detection: Utilizes computer vision techniques to detect the tennis ball in each video frame.
Player Detection: Detects players on the court and tracks their movements throughout the match.
Key Event Identification: Analyzes video frames to identify important events such as serves, rallies, and points scored.
Statistics Extraction: Post-processes the data to extract significant statistics about the match.

# Technologies

OpenCV: Used for image processing and object detection in video frames.
PyTorch: Used for advanced detection models and data processing.

# Example
